**ONE BIG QUESTION** keeps coming up about the knockout stages game, is the score to 90 mins?

**NO! If a match goes to extra time, points are awarded after based on the final AET score! Penalties are not included – so remember, you can still have a draw!**

Congratulations to **Fieldhurst8** £40 will be on its way, not bad for a free game. They managed another 30 point scoring game again which proved too much for the players around them – We will be in touch separately to get your bank details for the cash to be transferred.

Not as exciting today as last night. Brazil didn’t really come to the game. Switzerland did what they needed and then some. In the earlier games some fantastic names ending their world cup careers with Uruguay. Suarez didn’t even use his hands or show his teeth! There will be some cracking matches in the last 16.

**WhoLikesFootball** took the bait after a ribbing over the last couple of rounds for being bottom, certainly stepped up the game and finished second. **brodster76** ended up in 3rd place, 34 points behind the leader, with **Toby** joining him 3rd equal.

At the other end **emackie** finished bottom with only 36 points, **tootinator50** and **Cazf** round off the bottom 3. Better luck in the knockout round to you lot!

**Jojo** sitting in joint 10th is the only player in the top 10 to not have earned a single bonus point – if we didn’t have bonus points in this game they would have won the game!
