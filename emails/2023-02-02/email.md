# Premier League Update

Hi All,

Just a quick reminder that our first premier league game starts at 20:00 tomorrow. A minimum 1 in 17 people will win a cash prize, as early adopters you could have an even better chance of winning if we don’t have 50 people in each pool.

The format is the same, it’s a quicker game as it’s only over a matchday for the premier league games, from Friday to Monday this week. Get involved and try and win some cash.

As always, any feedback from you all for the new game is welcomed.
