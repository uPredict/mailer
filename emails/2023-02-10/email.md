# Premier League Update

Hi All,

The next matchday kicks off tomorrow with the first game at 12:30pm, you must be registered to play our game before 12:25pm. You don't even need to put in all your scores as you know you can change them, just make sure you are registered.

Last week's players had a 1 in 6 chance of winning a cash prize,  so don't miss out on your chance this week-end.

Good Luck All
