Some amazing scores this week-end, not least Everton beating Brighton 5-1 – lilyanne2269 and Viney777 being the only 2 in the top 10 predicting that win.

Which means that KainoTHFC finished top with 93 points, lilyanne2269 finished 2nd and SweetSweetNice landed in 3rd. Your accounts have been credited.
