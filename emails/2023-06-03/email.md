Thank you all for playing this year! 

The end of another season and the end of the first half season of uPredict – It’s been a learning curve and we are hoping to add in some new features over the summer and entice you all back. We will need the numbers to increase as well, and we are working on that side of things also, but nothing is better than word of mouth so keep spreading the word people. 

Congratulations to tootinator50 who scooped 1st prize with 92 points, jtibbs1307 came second 84 points behind and hoofhearted finished just behind him on 83   

**We will be back in touch before the new season starts – Thanks again for playing.**

Team uPredict
