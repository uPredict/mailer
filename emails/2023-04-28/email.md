Hello, 

Higher scoring week this week in the midweek games, but the same winner donpearson first to win 2 in a row, with 86 points and a fantastic 14 bonus points. In second place cityaregoingup had 82 and our resident blogger Kingy came 3rd. Congratulations all your accounts have been credited. 

**We are rolling straight into matchday 34 which starts tomorrow (Saturday 29th April) @ 12:30 – make sure you are in the game before 12:25** 

[Kingy has done some predictions for this week](https://medium.com/@ryan_80683/kingys-column-the-don-is-don-57dd1932a98c), with the quick turnaround it’s not so full of his witty banter, but if you need some help he is always there to lend a hand.
