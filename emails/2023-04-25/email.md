Hello, 

It was a very low scoring week this week with only 57 points winning the game, the past few weeks games have seen the winner needing around 90 points to win it – **donpearson** came 1st, **SweetSweetMice** finished 2nd and **trevorp** landed 3rd – your accounts have been credited. 

We are rolling straight into matchday 33 which starts today **(Tuesday 25th April) @ 19:30 – make sure you are in the game before 19:25**
