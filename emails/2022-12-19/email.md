What a fantastic final, I think I witnessed the best WC final ever – very happy for Messi and his Argentina team mates.

It was all kicking off on the uPredict table, with people going up and down all through the game. Congratulations to **FieldHurst8** our £40 winner, managing to get the 3 points he needed from the final game to keep him ahead of the chasing pack.

**MrKop14** finished second 4 points behind with **DylanMain2000** 1 point further back in 3rd.

Down at the bottom **WhoLikesFootball** finished bottom, 79 points away from first place. no change either in 2nd and 3rd last.

A big thank you to everyone who took part, we really learned a lot about the game and play as we went along. We hope you will come back and play the paid for games.

The site will be going back to Premier League soon, and then the paid games will start, keep an eye on it. You can also follow our socials if you like.

*We are launching a premier league “single matchday” game, this will be a paid for game with higher prizes and down to 3rd place, you will only ever play against 49 other players as we will put you in a pool of 50 with guaranteed prizes.*

*During the world cup with daily games, I will be sending emails out – if you don’t want to receive them give me a shout and I will take you off the list – If you want to give me some feedback as well, that would be great…When the premier league paid for games start there will be bigger prizes and for more places than just first.*
