Hi there, just a quick reminder to make sure you update your scores for the Quarter Finals, you can change each game up until 5 mins before they kick off.

Some interesting stats from round 3:-

Those predicting a correct result dropped down to 41%, however, those who predicted a perfect score jumped up by 10%.

We said there were a lot of bonus points in round 3 and they almost doubled from round 2 – 6% of all points in round 2 compared to 11% in round 3, there were a lot of upsets and some of you spotted them before they happened, well done.

Average points scored per player was 88 points which was a little down from round 2. **RichMurkin89** and **Stewarts76** were either side of that fence!

Here at uPredict HQ we have been keeping track of all the scores from all the games played so far and it shouldn’t come as a big surprise to see who is leading that table currently

**Dickie180** –        422

**Fieldhurst8** –     388

**Davewil1973** – 384

**RusselB** –            364

**Toby** –                 354

That’s the lot for today, we hope you are enjoying the game – Keep Predicting!
