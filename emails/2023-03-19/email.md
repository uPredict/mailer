# Matchday 28 winners

Hello,

Some strange games this week-end, **Summer53** is this week's winner, 57 points for the game plus 6 bonus giving then 63. **Danecfc** came second with 59 points and no bonus getting points in all but 1 game from the weekend. Last week’s winner **SweetSweetNice** is on a bit of a roll coming in third this week. Your accounts have been credited.

It’s time for the international break, so no game next week, but plenty of time to get some new players signed up.

**Matchday 29 starts on Sat 1st of April @12:30hrs – make sure you have entered the game prior to 12:25**
