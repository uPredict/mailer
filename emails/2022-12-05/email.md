The knockout games appear to be going the way most people would expect so no bonus points for anyone so far. Japan v Croatia had the potential for the first upset, but I don’t think the Japanese players even knew what a penalty was let alone practised them! Brazil and France are looking like the teams to beat.

Yesterday we had **MrKop14** leading the way, with **jojo** second, then a lot of people in 3rd equal, but it’s all change today.

**samparks** who was one of the 3rd equals is now leading the way in 1st, **Wags43** who was way down the table has suddenly jumped up into 2nd, with yesterday’s leader in 3rd.

**efdp** and **hoofhearted** were both in joint 25th yesterday and rocked up to joint 4th today!

At the other end **WhoLikesFootball** is back in their usual spot, collecting a lot of 3’s so far, **brodster76** is just above him with **RODNEYPOTS** ahead of him by 2 points.

*When the world cup is over, we are launching a premier league single matchday game, this will be a paid for game with higher prizes and down to 3rd place, you will only ever play against 49 other players as we will put you in a pool of 50 with guaranteed prizes.*

*During the world cup with daily games, I will be sending emails out – if you don’t want to receive them give me a shout and I will take you off the list – If you want to give me some feedback as well, that would be great…When the premier league paid for games start there will be bigger prizes and for more places than just first.*
