Hi All,

Congratulations MarkVenn73 who took the winnings this week - £120 will be added to your account. ejones who was winning all week-end dropped down to second and scoops £30. walker1081 came in 3rd and gets £15.

Unlucky to robbiebull who dropped out of the top 3 at the last gasp – MarkVenn was the only person in the top 4 who predicted a win for Liverpool, that was his winning blow.

You lucky people had a 1 in 7 chance of winning some cash this week, with a max pool size of 50 it will never be more than 1 in 17.

Make sure you spread the word, help us get 2 leagues playing this week.
