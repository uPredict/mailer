WELLLLLLLL…..What an amazing day of football, Brazil are out – tournament favourites by a long shot and they go out, and of all things on penalties! How did that happen?

The Dutch v the Argies, it was all done and dusted with just 10 minutes to go – then as football fans we were allowed another 30 minutes of watching these football giants slog it out. Diego Maradona watched over his Argentina side from up above and ensured they got through on penalties, who would have ever thought Van Dijk would have missed that first pen.

In the world of uPredict it has been crazy at the top, so much movement as each game progressed and changed, with our real time updates it has been an interesting watch!

**MrKop14** had 2-2 as the result for QF2 and that netted them the 15 points they needed to get them to the top. **Fieldhurst8** followed suite and lands in 2nd place 4 points behind. **MUTLEYMOVER** is a big mover, but is that because they forgot to predict this set of games?? 2 X 0-0 sees them land in 3rd.

Down at the bottom of the table **WhoLikesFootball** still holds up the table on their broad shoulders, **RODNEYPOTS** is still just above. Look at who is in 3rd from bottom though, our uPredict winner from round 2 **Nicolalisa**, good luck for the rest of the games, it’s bonus point chasing time for you three!

*When the world cup is over, we are launching a premier league “single matchday” game, this will be a paid for game with higher prizes and down to 3rd place, you will only ever play against 49 other players as we will put you in a pool of 50 with guaranteed prizes.*

*During the world cup with daily games, I will be sending emails out – if you don’t want to receive them give me a shout and I will take you off the list – If you want to give me some feedback as well, that would be great…When the premier league paid for games start there will be bigger prizes and for more places than just first.*
