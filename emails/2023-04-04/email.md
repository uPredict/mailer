Hello,

Well that was a spectacular end to the uPredict week-end, when Spurs were 1-0 up Viney777 was top of the league, with Everton down to 10 men looked like a sure thing, then Spurs get a sending off and an end of the game equaliser which allowed Richie to jump into first with 15 points for the spot on and beating Viny777 by just 3 points.

Congratulations to Richie on coming first, Viny777 coming second and Nmackie8 on coming third, your accounts have been credited.

Matchday 30 starts on Sat 8th of April @12:30hrs â€“ make sure you have entered the game prior to 12:25
