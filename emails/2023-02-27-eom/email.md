# uPredict Update

Hello,

It’s a repeat of last week – someone signs up, bags a free game and wins the jackpot – congratulations Joe0298 on your 1st place 20 points clear of second place so a convincing win – walker1081 (his second win) came in second and tootinator50 in 3rd just 3 points behind – your accounts have been credited.

The numbers are slowly rising, so would be great if you could get some friends involved next week.

Matchday 26 starts at 12:30 on Sat 4th of March – make sure you have entered the game prior to 12:25

Good Luck Everyone

Team uPredict
