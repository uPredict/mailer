Don’t forget to get your predictions in for the next couple of games..

We have some movement on the top, on Tuesday night **Smith171072** was leading and **Fiedhurst8** was second with **RussellB** following close behind, but then Wednesday happened…

However then **DylanMain2000** popped up out of nowhere and joined **FieldHurst8** in joint first, with his spectacular 12 bonus points. **Smith171072** is now in 3rd place. **MrKop14**, **just** and **Kingy** are all just right behind them.

Down at the bottom, there is no real change! Let's just leave it at that….Great world cup, it's all getting very exciting......

Who will win our last pre launch game......

*When the world cup is over, we are launching a premier league “single matchday” game, this will be a paid for game with higher prizes and down to 3rd place, you will only ever play against 49 other players as we will put you in a pool of 50 with guaranteed prizes.*

*During the world cup with daily games, I will be sending emails out – if you don’t want to receive them give me a shout and I will take you off the list – If you want to give me some feedback as well, that would be great…When the premier league paid for games start there will be bigger prizes and for more places than just first.*
