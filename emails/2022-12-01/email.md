What a great evening of football, nail biting stuff teams going out, staying in, going out, love the world cup. At some point all 4 teams could have been through. Spain didn’t really want to score in the last 10 mins, knock Germany out and Morocco in the next round.

**Fieldhurst8** leapfrogged into 1st place, with a 10 point lead over **Toby** in second. Both players grabbed 15 bonus points in the Japan v Spain game. **Fieldhurst8** with the spot on as well grabbing 30 points in that one.

Look who is back in the top 3, **Dickie180** a second and third in the first 2 rounds, can they close that 25 point gap on the final day and win it.

**Burnie83** has jumped into the top 10, the 4 goals for Germany helping him achieve a decent day’s total. Down at the bottom, **emackie**, **andyb** and **lilyanne2269** are holding up the table being 100+ points of the lead.

**AdyGillott** had a good day as well, 3 correct results and a correct score has helped him move into the top half of the table. While **rob.norman** swapped places and fell into the bottom half.

Make sure you tell your friends and get as many people signing up as possible. If you don’t see your mates on the table, give them a prod. Knockout round starts on Saturday, one game for all knockout games all the way to the final.

During the world cup with daily games, I will be sending emails out – if you don’t want to receive them give me a shout and I will take you off the list – If you want to give me some feedback as well, that would be great…When the premier league paid for games start there will be bigger prizes and for more places than just first.
