Hello predictors, the quarter finals finished in a flurry, of action Portugal going out to Morocco was a bit of a shocker, but not for some of our players. England going out to France was slightly more predictable, but they did put up a good fight.

Make sure you log in and update your scores for the semi-finals if you have not done so already.

The uPredict table has changed again with **Smith171072** getting the last 2 spot on with some decent bonus points has pushed them to the top of the table. 2 points behind is **Fieldhurst8** in 2nd and **RussellB** is 5 points further back in 3rd. With 4 games to go and only a 14 point spread down to Kingy in 6th it is anyone’s game. Some nice bonus points from Morocco on Wednesday could someone even further down get up to the top?

At the bottom **WhoLikesFootball** has remained holding up the table with **Nicolalisa** and **RODNEYPOTS** just slightly ahead.
