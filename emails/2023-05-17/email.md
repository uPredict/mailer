Hello, 

No one expected Arsenal to collapse so badly against Brighton, well no one except Moodyblue who bagged those critical bonus points to leave him top of the league and scooping the jackpot. Viney777 came in second while cityaregoingup finished in 3rd place. 

**Matchday 37 starts on Saturday 20th of May @12:30  – make sure you are in the game before 12:25**
