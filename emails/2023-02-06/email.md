# Premier League Update

Hi All,

What a great launch week-end on uPredict, while we didn’t get massive numbers we still payed out the guaranteed prizes as promised. The game worked well, Kingy was brave and went 1-0 Everton collecting a massive 18 bonus points. He could have been pipped at the post in the last game, but the prediction gods were smiling down on him. Nmackie8 stayed in the game and hot on his tails thanks to changing his Leeds v Forest prediction just before kick off. Our players had way better than a 1 in 17 chance of winning.

There we have it week 1 done and many more to come. Kingy won £120, Nmackie8 got £30 and SweetSweetNice won £15 for third place.

We would love to have more than one league running next week and have 6 or even 9 winners instead of 3, so get signed in, tell your friends, and join the next game. It starts at 12:25pm on this Saturday 11th.
