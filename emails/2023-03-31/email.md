Hi All,

What a great international break, but now time to get back to the Premier League and uPredict.

It’s time for some more uPredict – this week's game starts with Man City v Liverpool @ 12:30pm on Saturday, make sure you are registered to play the game by 12:25

Some great bonus points to chase this week, 10 for Bournemouth at home to Fulham could be one to go for.

If you need some help with your predictions, [have a read of Kingy’s blog](https://medium.com/@ryan_80683/kingys-column-i-can-see-daniel-waving-goodbye-a5faa7c1bbad)

Good Luck Everyone

Team uPredict
