# uPredict World Cup Update

The site has changed and Round 3 is now available, get logged on and hit enter game. Round 2’s results are in the “Available Game” drop down. Knockout round will appear shortly.

Not the best day of football, the Cameroon v Serbia game was a good one – at 3-1 down I thought they were going to lose but Cameroon fought back well. Portugal v Uruguay was a bit of a let-down. Cracking first goal from Ronaldo though. Brazil were not looking like the tournament favourites they are supposed to be.

However, great final day of round 2 for uPredict. **hanx1** ascended to first place, after **Nicolalisa** leading from the start and then dropped down to 2nd place, with **Dickie180** rounding off the top 3. What a great performance having also finished 2nd in round 1. Obviously has some skills this player!

**m.r.w.reed** moved up into the top 5 briefly before dropping down and finishing 19th as the day progressed.

We have a little confession here. **hanx1** is one of uPredict’s founders and so the £40 will be going to **Nicolalisa** – we will be in touch to get your bank details and transfer the cash. Can you work out who the other founders are?

At the other end of the table **SteveB** is bottom of the pack in this round with a well below average 4 correct results. Better luck in Round 3. **DanniBbz1504** didn’t do much better, second from bottom but managed to pick up some extra 3 pointers.

Make sure you tell your friends and get as many people signing up as possible. If you don’t see your mates on the table, give them a prod. Round 3 starts tomorrow at 3pm, last registration .

During the world cup with daily games, I will be sending emails out – if you don’t want to receive them give me a shout and I will take you off the list – If you want to give me some feedback as well, that would be great…When the premier league paid for games start there will be bigger prizes and for more places than just first.
