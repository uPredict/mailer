# Sometimes it's the draws that win it!

Welcome back everybody, what a cracking opening weekend of Premier League football.  Newcastle proved it will take more than a tough start to slow them down and Villa were the disappointment of the weekend, apart from VAR for Wolves fans obviously.

Congratulations to **ronald** and **cityaregoingup**. Most others went for the whopping 14 Spurs Bonus Points and a Liverpool win in the "who the hell knows?" fixture of the weekend. Those two correctly predicted a brace of draws in the sunday games to claim the top prizes. **cmac1993** and **Smith171072** completed the prze winners.  It didn't quite happen for them, but **lilyanne2269** must have thought they were going to steal top spot when Wolves looked like nicking it.  Special mention for **LukeyBoi**: uPredict don't hand out wooden spoons but with fewer than half the points of second bottom we'll give it some thought. 

**Matchday 2 starts on Friday 18th of August @ 19:45  â€“ make sure you are in the game before 19:40.**
